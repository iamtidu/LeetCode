# 143.Reorder List

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

`L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln`

Reorder the list to be on the following form:

`L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …`

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.


> Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4]

Output: [1,4,2,3]

>Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: [1,5,2,4,3]

 

## Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range 

[1, 5 * 104].

1 <= Node.val <= 1000

## Solution
1. steps
>Find the middle of the linked list:

+ Initialize two pointers, slow and fast, both pointing to the head of the linked list.
+ Move `slow` one step at a time and `fast` two steps at a time until fast reaches the end of the list or just before the end (depending on whether the list length is odd or even).
+ At this point, `slow` will be at the `middle` (or just before the middle) of the list.
>Split the list into two halves:

+ Set `secondHalf` pointer to the next node of slow.
+ Break the link between slow and secondHalf by setting `slow.next` to null, effectively splitting the list into two halves.
>Reverse the second half of the linked list:

+ Use a helper function `reverseList()` to reverse the `secondHalf` of the linked list.
+ This function reverses the pointers in the list, effectively flipping the direction of the list.
> Merge the first half and the reversed second half alternatively:

+ Initialize a pointer current to the head of the original list.
While secondHalf is not null:
+ Keep track of the next nodes of current and secondHalf to avoid losing them during reassignment.
+ Point current.next to secondHalf and secondHalf.next to the next node of current.
+ Move current and secondHalf to their respective next nodes for the next iteration.

Finally, the original list would be reordered with elements from the first half followed by elements from the second half, in an alternating manner.

            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        ListNode secondHalf = slow.next;

        // Step 2: Reverse the second half of the linked list

            current = temp1;
            secondHalf = temp2;
        }
    }
    
    // Helper function to reverse a linked list
    private ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode current = head;
        
        while (current != null) {
            ListNode nextNode = current.next;
            current.next = prev;
            prev = current;
            current = nextNode;
        }
        
        return prev;
    }
}
